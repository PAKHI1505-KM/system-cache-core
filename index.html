  <p>
I don’t think I ever tell you enough how deeply you matter to me. You’re not just someone I love—you’re someone I choose, again and again. In every version of my life, in every high and low, it’s you I want beside me.<br><br>

I promise you this with my whole heart: whatever comes our way, we will face it together. When life feels heavy, I’ll carry the weight with you. When you’re tired, I’ll be your rest. When you doubt yourself, I’ll remind you of who you are and how strong you truly are. I won’t walk away when things get hard—I’ll hold on tighter.<br><br>

You’re my comfort, my courage, my home. Loving you has taught me patience, strength, and hope. Even on the days when words fail or everything feels uncertain, one thing will always stay clear—I’m on your side. Always.<br><br>

I promise to grow with you, to fight for us, to protect what we have, and to never give up on you or us. No matter where life takes us, my heart will find its way back to you every single time.<br><br>

This isn’t just a Valentine’s promise. It’s a forever one.<br><br>

<b>— Yours, Pakhi</b>
